# LightBTS

This is a lightweight bug tracker. The main goal is to make bug tracking as
easy as possible. Once installed, you can start a bug tracker instance in any
directory you want, simply by calling:

    lightbts-cli init

From that point on, you can create, modify and close tickets using the command
line interface from that directory, or any of its subdirectories. If you know
git, you will fell instantly familiar with this way of working. However,
LightBTS itself does not require git in any way. To learn about all the
commands that the command line interface supports, just type:

    lightbts-cli help

## Features

* Command-line interface
