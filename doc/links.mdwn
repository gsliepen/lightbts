Linking bugs
------------

Bug A can declare a link to another bug B.
A link can have a type.
There can be only one link from A to B,
but B to A is seen as a distict link.

## Link types

Relates:
: A declares a generic relationship with bug B.
Duplicates:
: A is a duplicate of bug B.
Depends:
: A depends on bug B to be closed before A itself can be closed.
Blocks:
: A declares it must be closed before bug B can be closed.

Depends/Blocks are just the reverse of each other, but since A and B can be owned by different owners, it's probably best to keep both types.

## Effects of linking

For the database itself, links are just another piece of information.
However, some actions should happen in response to actions on bugs that have links to other bugs, or have other bugs link to it.

When a bug is closed, and other bugs are duplicate of the first bug, the other bugs should be closed as well.
Open bugs that declare they are a duplicate of another bug should become immutable until the bug it duplicates is closed.

When a bug is closed that says it depends on other bugs, and not all of those other bugs are closed, the close message must be rejected.
When a bug is closed and there are other open bugs that claim they block the first bug, then the close message should be rejected (unless forced?).

When a link is created, the message causing the link creation should be forwarded to the recipients of both bugs.
