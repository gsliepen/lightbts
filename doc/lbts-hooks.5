.Nd Hooks supported by LightBTS
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Hooks are programs that are called in response to certain changes occurring in a LightBTS instance.
Hooks that don't exist or don't have the executable bit set are ignored.

By default the hooks directory is
.Pa .lightbts/hooks ,
but that can be changed via the
.Va core.hooks
configuration variable.
.Pp
Before LightBTS calls a hook, it changes its working directory to LightBTS's data directory.
Hooks are called without arguments, information is passed solely via environment variables.
Output to stdout and stderr is ignored.
The exit code of a hook can influence the behavior of LightBTS.
