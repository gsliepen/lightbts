Hooks
-----

Hooks are scripts that are called because of certain events.
Hooks are placed in the `hooks/` subdirectory of LightBTS's directory.
Hooks must be made executable before they will run.

## Supported hooks

`pre-index`:
: This is called when a new message is to be imported into the database. If this hook exits with a non-zero exit code, the message will be rejected.
`post-index`:
: This is called when a new message has been imported and indexed into the database. 

## Environment variables

Hooks are called without any arguments.
Instead, any parameters are passed via environment variables.

`MESSAGE_FILE`:
: This contains the full path to the message file. It is strongly recommended that you do not modify, move or delete the file in any way.
`BUG_ID`:
: In the post-index hook, this is set to the bug number assigned to the bug.
