Bug splitting
-------------

A common action is to split a bug into several subtasks.
When working with email, it would be nice if one can reply to the original bug report and in one go create another bug that relates to the first one.
Suggested format:

```
From: user@example.com
To: bts@example.com
Message-ID: reply1@foo
In-Reply-To: msg1@foo
Subject: Re: Bug#1: big task

Split: subtask 1
Owner: coworker@example.com

We need to bla first.
```

While it is a reply to an existing message, it will in fact create a new bug, set the title to "subtask 1",
perform all the other control fields actions on the new bug, and automatically adds a Blocks link back to the original bug.
It should have exactly the same effect as sending a new message with the contents:

```
From: user@example.com
To: bts@example.com
Message-ID: msg2@foo
Subject: subtask 1

Blocks: 1
Owner: coworker@example.com

We need to bla first.
```

Since we depend on Message-IDs for linking messages together, we cannot do more than one split per message.
